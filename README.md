# Rainydays - Cross Course Project

A simple overview of the use/purpose of the project.

## Description

The Rainydays site has been built as a result of several subjects in my studies at Noroff. A prototype in Figma was first made in the Design course. Then, the HTML & CSS course brought the site to the web as a static web page. In the Interaction Design Course, improvements were made to the page, and some JavaScript was added. And finally, in the Content Management Systems Course, the page was linked up with WordPress through the REST API as a headless CMS for hosting products.
